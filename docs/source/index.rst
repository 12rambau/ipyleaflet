Introduction to ipyleaflet
==========================
Ipyleaflet is a Jupyter / Leaflet bridge enabling interactive maps in the Jupyter notebook. It is an interactive widgets library, based on ipywidgets. This means that everything in ipyleaflet (e.g. the Map, TileLayers, Layers, Controlsâ€¦) is interactive: you can dynamically update attributes from Python or from the Notebook interface.
